# EDA Girl Scout Project

The goal of this project was to assist a Girl Scout troop in maximizing their girl scout cookie sales for the season by choosing the best NYC subway station to set up their operation. I used the MTA turnstile subway data and Statistical Atlasâ€™s Census data to determine the stations with the highest amount of foot traffic closest to family-demographic neighborhoods. I used these sources to map out the station locations and neighborhoods on Google Earth and determine the tops stations closest to these neighborhoods.
